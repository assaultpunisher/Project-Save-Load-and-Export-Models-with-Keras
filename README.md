# Project-Save-Load-and-Export-Models-with-Keras
### Keras
Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear & actionable error messages. It also has extensive documentation and developer guides.

## Things Done in Project
- Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch
- Perform logistic regression with NumPy and Python
- Create data visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
